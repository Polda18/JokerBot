# JokerBot
A Discord bot "Joker", completely built upon TypeScript

## COMING SOON
This bot is probably going to use [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) framework. It will fully support slash commands, interactions, and (if possible) also integration of Discord's Automod and Customization API in future. Stay in touch on my [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/TheCZghost) or join my [development Discord server](https://discord.gg/YcDkrFU) and subscribe for updates.
